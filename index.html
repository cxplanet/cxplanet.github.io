This site helps me reinforce/remember machine learning topics, while taking the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning">UW Machine Learning Specialization</a> given
by Emily Fox and Carlos Guestrin. I totally recommend these courses - the classes are great at explaining the fundamentals of machine learning.
<div class="main_sections">
<p>Math Notation - Even though there seems to be a wide variety of specific notation used by machine learning practitioners,
    learning and recalling core concepts is easier when you understand commonly used symbols and formulas</p>
<p>Linear Algrebra</p>
<p>Linear Regression</p>
    <p>Logistic Regression are two popular types of regression</p>
<p>Common issues include <a href="http://insidebigdata.com/2014/10/22/ask-data-scientist-bias-vs-variance-tradeoff/">variance vs bias</a></p>
